# simple blockchain

Well, I like the idea of bitcoin and blockchain itself and find it quite smart. Here is a very basic proof-of-concept blockchain.
Please mind that it is **not decentralized** as true blockchain, because I implemented it by an HTTP server, but not by peer-to-peer network. Maybe, I'll build it by P2P network later, but now it is what it is.
